### Homepage Snippets

This repository contains snippets for the ably.com homepage as required by [SDK-878](https://ably.atlassian.net/browse/SDK-878)

### Contributing

To add a new set of snippets create a top level directory in this repository named after the language the snippets are for and add the snippets in that directory.

Please use the [JavaScript snippets](/javascript) as a reference for other languages.

The recommended maximum length for each line of code in a snippet is 60 characters to fit nicely within the homepage design, but the absolute maximum length is 64 characters to avoid wrapping to the next line.

The recommended maximum number of lines in a snippet is 5 to avoid a scrollbar appearing, but this is subject to change.
